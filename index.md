I am a Project Research Assistant VI at the University of the Philippines Los Baños – School of Environmental Science and Management (UPLB–SESAM)'s [SARAI] (https://sarai.ph) Program. We are working on the institutionalizaing of the adoption of SARAI's Integrated Crop Monitoring and Forecasting (ICMF) system to help promote climate resilient agriculture in the Philippines.

I also conduct research on the use of remote sensing and geospatial analysis to assess and monitor the impacts of catastrophic typhoons to natural and built-up environments.
